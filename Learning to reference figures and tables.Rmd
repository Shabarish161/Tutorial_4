## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Learning to reference figures
```{r}
x = seq(1:100)
y = rnorm(1:100)

dat = data.frame(x,y)
ggplot (dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line()
```
```{r}
"This is a random Noise"
```

# Learning to reference tables
```{r}
dat_head <- head(dat, n = 5)
kableExtra::kable(dat_head)
```

The below table indicates the x and y variables of the dataset.
